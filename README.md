# College-Portfolio
 Some sample projects from the Cairn University Computer Science program. This program was extremely project-heavy, with multiple group final projects scattered throughout the program. One such group project is the database project hosted here: https://github.com/Kali-Will-Michael-Yehun/CIS221-CairnAlumniProj. The others included in this repository are a representative sample of my coding projects, showcasing my strongest languages.
