# River Run Simulation: Java Classes
### This River simulation was an introduction to Java classes in a 200 level Data Structures and Algorithms class. 
### It involved filling an array representing a river with fish and bear objects, and in each of a series of iterations:
- Each animal moved left or right one spot. 
- Bears consumed fish when bear and fish competed for a spot.
- If bears did not eat for a certian number of iterations, they starved and were removed
- If two bear or two fish objects collided, a baby was produced in a random empty space
